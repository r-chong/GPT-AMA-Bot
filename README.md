# Ask-me-anything Interview Chatbot
Welcome to my Ask-me-anything interview chatbot! This chatbot is designed to answer questions on my behalf and provide a modern version of a bio. It's a great way to showcase my personality and expertise while engaging with potential employers, clients, or collaborators.

## How it works
The chatbot is built using the GPT-3 language model by OpenAI, which allows it to generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions. When a user asks a question, the chatbot processes the message and generates a response that is displayed in the chat window.

To make the chatbot more interactive and engaging, I've added various features such as icons, typing indicators, and animations. These features help to create a more natural and conversational experience for the user.

## Getting started
To use the chatbot, simply visit my portfolio site and click on the chatbot icon. The chat window will open, and you can start asking questions right away. The chatbot is designed to handle a wide range of topics, so feel free to ask anything you want!

## Customization
The chatbot is highly customizable and can be tailored to your specific needs. You can easily modify the code to change the chatbot's responses, add new features, or customize the user interface. If you have any questions or need help getting started, don't hesitate to contact me!

## Conclusion
