# What is this?
Welcome to my Ask-me-anything interview chatbot! 

This is a custom chatbot buit on GPT-3.5 that is designed to answer questions on my behalf and provide a modern version of a bio. Ask any question about me, and the AI Assistant will answer, in real time!

# The Journey of GPT-Interview-Bot

ChatGPT has taken the world by storm over the last six months of its beta release. As an aspiring young developer, naturally I wanted to try my hand at making something with this cool new piece of tech while it was still relevant! At the same time, I had started preparing for the RBC Summer Tech Labs position, with applications opening up a few months away. Thinking ahead, I knew that I would need to make a portfolio website. Of course, I wanted some way to make it unique, because if you know anything about me, I will not settle for the default ðŸ˜„. Thus came my idea: What if, instead of having a static webpage talking about myself, viewers could just ASK me? Before, I would have had to sit at my computer and answer each and every question, but with AI, this could be automated, I thought.

Over the next few months, I brainstormed how I could accomplish this. ChatGPT is very interesting in that everyone knows how to use it, but hardly anyone knows how it works internally. I had to learn a ton about tokenization, API calling, and whether or not I would need to build my own AI model. Thankfully, I stumbled upon a video from Hugging Face AI, talking about "pre-prompting" and how you could give the AI context through system messages, instead of going through and fine-tuning an entire new algorithm. This revolutionized everything. I wouldn't need to train my computer on a bazillion different questions about myself, I could use OpenAI's base product, which is DaVinci 003, and build upon it with futher pre-prompting. This is the story of GPT-Interview-Bot.

## How it works

The chatbot is built using the GPT-3 language model by OpenAI. When a user asks a question, the chatbot processes the message, and adds on a custom "pre-prompted" message that I have programmed into the API request (see `apiRequestBody`), and generates a response that is displayed in the chat window. There were some hiccups along the way, but I am proud to say that this was my first app created using the GPT API and I plan for many more to come.

To make the chatbot more interactive and engaging, I've added various features such as icons, typing indicators, and animations. These features help to create a more natural and conversational experience for the user.

# Future work
In the near future, I plan to embed this proof-of-concept into my future portfolio site and upgrade the AI model to GPT-4.
